# Architecture

## Adafel architecture holistic view


There are three major components of the Adafel Protocol:

1. Adafel Rollup - an appchain specifically designed to provide infrastructure onchain ML operations
2. Open Data Library (ODL) - it is the data layer that is integrated with dapps to collect and aggregate user analytics and push to Adafel rollup
3. Prediction Engine - ML model on Adafel Protocol when integrated with ODL can be used for predictions
